		<h1>A summer day on Mount St. Helens.</h1>
		</br>
		<p>
			Washington state is always beautiful during the summers.
			I can even go as far to say that it's probably the most beautiful state in the continental United States during the summers.
			I say 'continental United States' coz I mean let's be honest, nothing can top Alaska and Hawaii duhhh !
			Coming back to Washington state, she certainly is pretty and will always hold a special place in my heart.
			I guess it's also because I am currently living here ;D
			</br></br>
		</p>
		<p>
			On one of those summer days filled with copious sunlight, I convinced my friend Rujuta to go on an adventure with me to Mount Saint Helens.
			We got up in the wee hours of the morning hopped in my Blue Prius named Pinky and started our escapade.
			Driving about an hour and half down south of Seattle we reached the Castle Rock Visitor center right on time for the ranger Program.
			</br></br>

		</br></br>
		<p>
			The ranger told us all about how the mountain stood tall and proud before the fateful day of May, 18th 1980 when it erupted and cascaded into half its size.
			Pretty much reminding me of my mum, when she'd erupted on my dad for calling her a 'short cylinder' in front of the guests.
			Except for she didn't cascade into half her size she was already short :D The woman stands 4 feet 11 inches tall, my dad towering over her at 5 feet 11 inches.
			I wonder how the 'logistics' work (Note to self donâ€™t mum read this article, she may erupt again).
			</br></br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Anywho, Rujuta and I strolled through the swamp attached to the visitor center. Ok, I just googled apparently that swamp's called Silver lake.
			Regardless, it was a pretty disappointing boardwalk. I guess the saving grace was having Rujuta around.
			After lamenting about our dating experiences and astonishment over people enjoying the swampy boardwalk we decided to head over to the Johnston Ridge Observatory.
			</br></br>

		</br></br>
		<p>
			Aah there she stood, in all her glory. I must also acknowledge the fact that it was a particularly clear day and,
			we were very fortunate to have experienced her every curve and edge. (Yes, I am still talking about the mountain here ;D)
			The observatory had tons of information about the mountain including some films and a huge 3d map of the mountain region.
			</br></br>
		</p>
		<p>
			I remember one of the rangers there telling me that the mountain on the Washington state license plate is actually Mt. St. Helenes but,
			I don't reckon that's actually true. Although, the mountain surprisingly does resemble the one on the license plate.
			</br></br>
		</p>

		<figcaption>This looked way better in real life.</figcaption>
		</br></br>
		<p>
			We hiked up a bit more, found a bench with the view of the mountain and ate our lunch.
			There was definitely something mesmerising about that mountain that made us forget about our traumatizing date experiences, well at least for a brief moment.
			</br></br>

		<figcaption>The water wasn't really that cold.</figcaption>
		</br></br>
		<p>
			As the afternoon progressed we decided to visit the Coldwater lake.
			We strolled on the paved trail and did a lot of people watching.
			It always amuses me when I see the kind of things people do to take that perfect instagram picture.
			Climbing over fences, going in water, laying in sand, sitting on top of tree branches, almost getting eaten by bears.
			Aah! humans never cease to amaze me.
			</br></br>
		</p>
		<img src="../img/logs/Mt-St-Helens/SpringBloom.jpg">
		<figcaption>I know right, we chose a really good day to visit.</figcaption>
		</br></br>
		<p>
			As the evening approached we decided to head back home.
			Even though I took this trip almost 2 years ago, the memories are still fresh in my head as if it was yesterday.
			I guess, it's because you never forget your first encounters with something so beautiful that you don't mind it not being full.
