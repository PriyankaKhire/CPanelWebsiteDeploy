		<h1>DDA on Half Moon Bay</h1>
		</br>
		<p>
			It was one of those covid weekends where I decided that being cooped up in the house was no longer keeping me sane.
			So, I decided to drag my friend along on the beach.
			After hunting for about 15-20 minutes we finally found that sacrosanct spot, a spot so perfect that even his holiness would have had tears in his eyes had he gazed upon.
			(Alright, I am done with the exaggeration)
			</br></br>
			Merely 5 minutes after settling into the 'spot' your's truly was bored.
			I mean, what does one do on a beach ? If you are a kid, you build a sand castle.
			If you are family, you argue and disagree and probably yell at your kids for going too deep into the ocean to get water for their sand castle.
			If you are a couple, you do the quintessential 'holding hands and walking on the side of the beach'.
			However, I was non of those, I was here with my girl friend who loved dipping her toes into the ocean, watching the waves and retrospecting about life and perhaps just being in the moment.
			I enjoyed none of those things, I guess it's my constant need to physically do 'something' all the times doesn't really allow me to just be in the moment and not do anything.
			</br></br>
			Anyhow, lucky for me, I'd gotten along a couple of books and, Designing Data-Intensive Applications (DDA) was the clear winner !
			After reading a couple of pages of chapter 2 and realizing the true importance of enums, I was finally successful in convincing my friend to go have coffee with me.

			Since, most of the coffee places were closed and we were also getting a bit peckish, we decided to go French and ended up at <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/mavericks-creperie-half-moon-bay">Mavericks Creperie</a>.
			The food over there was pretty tasty. After which we decided to call it a day and head home. Overall, I'd say it was a pretty great day to read DDA :D
